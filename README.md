### Hi there!
- I'm a learner, with some experience in Python (using Pycharm) and currently studying the Dart and C++ languages (using VS Code).
- I study Economics and Computer Science at Hillsdale College, where I am a sophomore.
- I'm currently working on a mobile app designed to help kids with ASD set more clearly defined goals, develop independence, and live better lives.
- I'm looking to learn more about front-end development and GUI design.
- Reach me at iestabrook@hillsdale.edu
